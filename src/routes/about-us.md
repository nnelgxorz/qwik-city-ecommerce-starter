## Qwik City Overview

Qwik City is a companion meta-framework to Qwik. Use Qwik City to create websites and webapps. (Currently, Qwik City is focusing on multi-page-application (MPA) development, but single-page-application (SPA) development is next on our roadmap.)

Use Qwik City to build an e-commerce website, blog site, or any other website that needs routing, layouts, templating, data retrieval/updates, and behavior. Qwik City is built on Qwik, and therefore Qwik City sites are resumable and only download the minimal amount of JavaScript with fine-grained lazy loading.

Qwik City provides:

- File-based routing
- Nested layouts
- File-based menus
- Breadcrumbs
- Support authoring content with `.tsx` or `.mdx` file formats
- Data endpoints

Qwik City sites are fast by default:

- Are resumable
- Downland minimal JavaScript
- Come with Partytown
